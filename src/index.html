# Introduction
    
All right! The first thing to to is to invent an elaborated scenario for our game.
What about the story in which a beautiful princess has disappeard? The desperate hero will take its courage and cross many lands, fighting monsters and avoiding traps to find her.


The hero will have only 7 possible actions (keystrokes or touchable icons):
* move to North,
* move to South,
* move to East,
* move to West,
* jump,
* use an object,
* select another object.


The view will be in false 3D. Also known as othrographic projection. Parallels always remain parallel and far objects have the same size as near objects. The camera angle never changes. Several objects (like hero, monsters, gems, ...) will be rendered as flat images (aka sprites). The viewport will be a square and it will scale with the screen real size.

__Lots of constraints involve more artistic creativity!__

We also have ambitious exigencies. Our hero should be able to climb ladders which means that we need a real 3D world. And we want it big and fast to be rendered.
