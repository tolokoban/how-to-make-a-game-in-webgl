# World geometry

We need coordinates!
Let's agree that the unit will be the width of our hero:
* When the hero goes North or South he changes it's __Z__ coordinate.
* When the hero goes East or West he changes it's __X__ coordinate.
* When the hero goes Up or Down he changes it's __Y__ coordinate.

We need a mathematical formula to transform 3D coords into 2D.

> <x-latex>x = X + \alpha Z</x-latex>
> <x-latex>y = Y + \beta Z</x-latex>
